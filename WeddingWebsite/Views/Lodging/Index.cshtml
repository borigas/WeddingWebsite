        <h2>Union College Dorms</h2>
        <p>
            We have also worked with Union College so that we can offer dorm rooms to guests.
            Prescott Hall rooms include two twin beds and share a bathroom with another room.
            Rees Hall rooms include two twin beds but all rooms share a common hall bathroom.
            It is $10 per night per room in either dorm.
            Reminder: dorm rooms do not have bedding and other amenities such as towels or hair dryers.
            The room will ONLY include beds and each guest must provide their own linens, pillows and personal amenities.
            <br />
            <br />
